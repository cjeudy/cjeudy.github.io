## Abstract
> The recent advances of quantum technologies are threatening the cryptographic mechanisms that are currently deployed in most cybersecurity systems. It is thence necessary to find alternatives to these mechanisms which are not subject to quantum attacks. Lattice-based cryptography is an interesting and versatile candidate that withstands quantum attacks, and it is considered the most promising option to date. This paper describes the foundations of lattice-based cryptography, as well as digital signature and encryption schemes which are on track to replace current cryptographic standards.
