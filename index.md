I am a cryptography researcher at Orange Innovation in the [Applied Cryptography Group](https://crypto.orange-labs.fr/). My [PhD thesis](/publications/design_of_advanced_post_quantum_signature_schemes) was on the design of advanced post-quantum signature schemes from lattices, under the supervision of [Adeline Roux-Langlois](https://people.irisa.fr/Adeline.Roux-Langlois/) (IRISA), [Olivier Sanders](https://crypto.orange-labs.fr/acg/people/peopleProfil.php?id=226) (Orange Labs) and [Pierre-Alain Fouque](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fouque/) (IRISA). I was awarded an accessit to the [Gilles Kahn 2025 thesis prize](https://www.socinfo.fr/palmares-du-prix-de-these-gilles-kahn-2025/) for my PhD thesis, with the distinction "Thesis with Industrial Impact".

# About Me

I am a research engineer at Orange Innovation in the [Applied Cryptography Group](https://crypto.orange-labs.fr/). I am working on post-quantum cryptography, and more precisely on designing advanced lattice-based signature schemes for privacy applications. Feel free to check out my quick introduction [video](videos/a_quick_intro_to_lattice_cryptography) on lattice cryptography.

I completed my PhD on the subject in June 2024. It was done in collaboration with the [CAPSULE team](https://team.inria.fr/capsule/) at INRIA/IRISA in Rennes, and under the supervision of [Adeline Roux-Langlois](https://people.irisa.fr/Adeline.Roux-Langlois/) (IRISA), [Olivier Sanders](https://crypto.orange-labs.fr/acg/people/peopleProfil.php?id=226) (Orange Labs) and [Pierre-Alain Fouque](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fouque/) (IRISA). I was awarded an accessit to the [Gilles Kahn 2025 thesis prize](https://www.socinfo.fr/palmares-du-prix-de-these-gilles-kahn-2025/) for my PhD thesis, with the distinction "Thesis with Industrial Impact".

Before that, I was a research intern (Jan. - Jul. 2020 & Apr. - Sep. 2021) supervised by [Adeline Roux-Langlois](https://people.irisa.fr/Adeline.Roux-Langlois/). I was working on the computational assumptions underlying lattice-based cryptosystems, namely the Module Learning With Errors problem.  

In April 2021, I completed my master of engineering in the cybersecurity specialization at [Centrale Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/). From July 2019 to December 2019, I worked as a cybersecurity engineering intern at Thales LAS on risk analysis and cryptography applied to critical industrial systems. Prior to that, I visited [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) as an exchange student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) from January 2019 to June 2019.  
Before that, in 2017, I completed my two years of preparatory classes in Mathematics and Physics at [Lycée Jacques Amyot](https://www.lyceejamyot-melun.fr/main.php?page=85). My thesis project was on the _theory and implementation of the signature scheme ECDSA_.
