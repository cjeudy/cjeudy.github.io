Here is a short video explaining the basic principles of lattice-based cryptography. This provides the general landscape without going into the details of reductions, nor security proofs. Some aspects like discrete Gaussian distributions, dual lattices, or lattice geometry that are primary in lattice cryptography are not covered.

The animations are done with the [manim Python library](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) developed by Grant Sanderson, owner of the [3Blue1Brown Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), and many other contributors.
